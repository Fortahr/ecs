# Entity-Component-System

Heavily templated ECS system, focused on bringing the least amount of overhead, where components are known at compile time.

* Alpha state, still a WIP,
* Archetype ECS Model,
* Header only,
* C++17,
* Pre-registered components,
* Makes use of STL containers, e.g.: `vector` and `tuple`,
* Bitmask component lookups, currently up to 64 components,
* Query components by function/lambda parameters,
* Exclude components in queries,
* Up to 256 worlds supported, keeping the `entity` type at 8 bytes of size,


# Query examples

Call lambda on all entities that have the `One` and `Two` components and do operations on both
```cpp
world.query([](One& one, Two& two) -> void
{
	// do something with `one` and/or `two`
});
```

Call lambda on all entities that have the `One` and `Four`, but not `Three` components and do operations on `Four`
```cpp
world.query<One, ecs::exclude<Three>>([](Four& four) -> void
{
	// do something with `four`
});
```

Call lambda on all entities that don't have the component `One` and do something with the entity id
```cpp
world.query<ecs::exclude<One>>([](Entity entity) -> void
{
	// do something with `entity`
});
```

Count all entities that have the `One`, `Six`, and `Seven`, but not `Three` components.
```cpp
size_t count = world.count<One, Six, Seven, ecs::exclude<Three>>();
```

# Benchmark

Notes:
* See [benchmark/Main.cpp](https://github.com/Fortahr/ecs/blob/main/benchmark/Main.cpp) and [benchmark/Benchmarker.h](https://github.com/Fortahr/ecs/blob/main/benchmark/Benchmarker.h) for the the benchmark code,
* Results fluctuate, like the winner of above comparison changes each run, but are always close,
* Archetypes with only 1 component run around the same speed as its raw counterpart,
* Archetypes with more than 1 component run slower than raw with only 1 component,
* Simple, single-ish instructions seem to come out as a bit slower than its raw counterpart (needs confirmation).

# WIP

2. Entity id system needs testing,
3. Production environment testing,
4. Task Scheduler,
4. R&D for omission of global entity id reservations, reducing memory footprint, some ideas;
	1. grouping, 1 id for a whole group (e.g.: static geometry),
	2. entity is never targeted, removed with world,
	3. only reserve id when actually targeted.
